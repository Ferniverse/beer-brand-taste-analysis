## 🧠 Overview  
This case study examines whether consumers can truly distinguish the taste of popular domestic beer brands — **Budweiser**, **Coors**, and **Miller** — or if their preferences are influenced more by branding and mental imagery than by flavor itself.  

The project demonstrates applied knowledge in **research methods**, **validity evaluation**, and **analytical reasoning** — essential skills for any data or research analyst.

## 🧪 Research Setup  
- **Objective:** Determine whether taste preferences reflect genuine sensory differences or brand perception.  
- **Participants:** 100 adult males recruited at a suburban Detroit shopping mall.  
- **Method:**  
  - Each participant sampled all three beers, served in dark glasses to conceal branding.  
  - Each glass was labeled only with a letter (“S,” “N,” “Q”).  
  - Participants cleansed their palate with bread between tastings.  
  - All participants tasted in the same order.  
- **Results:**  
  - Budweiser — 51 preferences  
  - Coors — 32 preferences  
  - Miller — 17 preferences

## 🔬 Variables  
- **Independent Variable:** Beer brand (Budweiser, Coors, Miller)  
- **Dependent Variable:** Reported taste preference (which beer was chosen as best tasting)  

---

## ⚙️ Research Design  
- **Type:** Within-Subjects Experimental Design  
Each participant experienced all three conditions and reported their preference, enabling direct within-participant comparison.  

---

## ⚖️ Threats to Validity  

### Internal Validity  
- **Issue:** *Order Effects* — all participants tasted in the same sequence, which may have influenced responses.  
- **Solution:** Implement **counterbalancing**, where the tasting order varies among participants to control for sequence bias.  

### External Validity  
- **Issue:** *Sampling Bias* — participants were all male adults from one geographic area, limiting generalizability.  
- **Solution:** Recruit a **more diverse sample** across gender, age, and location to improve representativeness.

## 💭 Evaluation of Conclusions  
Although participants favored Budweiser most often, concluding that beer drinkers “clearly distinguish” between brands is premature.  
The study’s internal and external validity issues suggest results may reflect context and sample bias more than true sensory discrimination.
